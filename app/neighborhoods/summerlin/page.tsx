            Why Summerlin is One of Las Vegas's Premier Neighborhoods
          </h2>
          
          <div className="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-8 mb-12">
            <div>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Summerlin stands out as Las Vegas's premier master-planned community, spanning over 22,500 acres in the foothills of the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area. Developed by The Howard Hughes Corporation since 1990, Summerlin represents the gold standard for master-planned living in the Las Vegas Valley.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                The community seamlessly blends residential neighborhoods with commercial centers, parks, schools, golf courses, and 150+ miles of trails. What sets Summerlin apart is its commitment to quality of life: carefully planned infrastructure, architectural guidelines that maintain property values, and an emphasis on community amenities that bring neighbors together.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
                Unlike many Las Vegas areas that developed organically over time, Summerlin was planned from the ground up with the resident experience in mind. Every aspect - from traffic flow to park placement to school locations - was designed to create an ideal living environment. This intentional planning results in less crime, better property values, and a higher quality of life.

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
            The Summerlin real estate market consistently performs well due to strong buyer demand, limited inventory, and excellent amenities.

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Summerlin Homes Hold Their Value</h3>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Summerlin properties maintain strong resale value due to several factors. First, the master-planned nature ensures infrastructure continues improving rather than deteriorating. Second, architectural guidelines and active HOAs maintain neighborhood aesthetics and prevent properties from becoming dated or run-down. Third, the limited land supply means less new competition.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Additionally, Summerlin's reputation attracts buyers willing to pay premiums. Golf course properties, particularly those overlooking TPC Summerlin or other championship courses, command even higher prices and appreciate faster. Waterfront properties in developments like The Paseos and The Willows also see exceptional value retention.
            </p>
            <p>
              For sellers, Summerlin's strong market means faster sales at better prices. For buyers, it means your investment is safer and likely to appreciate. Understanding these dynamics helps you price competitively when selling or identify value when buying.
            </p>
          </div>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Competition in Summerlin is often fierce, especially for well-priced properties in desirable sub-communities. Buyers need to be prepared to act quickly and make strong offers. Pre-approval, competitive pricing, and flexible terms often make the difference.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Popular areas include The Trails with its extensive trail system, The Foothills offering mountain views, Sun City for active adults, and Highland Hills with its central location. Each sub-community has unique character, amenities, and price points ranging from entry-level condos to luxury estates.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Timing matters in Summerlin. Spring and fall typically see more inventory as families time their moves around school schedules. Winter sees fewer listings but also less competition. Summer can be slower due to heat, though motivated sellers often list during this time.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Summerlin sellers benefit from strong demand, but preparation still matters. Properties that show well, are priced correctly, and marketed effectively sell fastest. Professional staging, quality photography, and strategic pricing often yield multiple offers.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Understanding your sub-community's market dynamics is crucial. Some areas like The Paseos and The Willows with water features command premium pricing. Golf course homes, particularly those with course views, can sell significantly above neighborhood medians.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Working with a Summerlin specialist like Dr. Janet Duffy provides valuable insights into pricing strategy, buyer expectations, and negotiating position. Her track record with expired listings shows she understands how to position properties that didn't sell previously for successful relisting.

            What It's Like Living in Summerlin
          </h2>
          
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8">
            Living in Summerlin means enjoying master-planned community benefits: well-maintained infrastructure, abundant amenities, safe neighborhoods, and strong community identity. Residents consistently rate quality of life highly, citing everything from the trail system to school quality to property value stability.
          </p>

            <div>
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900">Recreation and Amenities</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Summerlin's recreational amenities are world-class. The community boasts 10 golf courses including TPC Summerlin (home to a PGA Tour event), five public golf courses, and several private club courses. Golf course living here means more than just golf - it means scenic views, meticulously maintained landscaping, and added property value.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                The trail system is exceptional: over 150 miles of trails winding through neighborhoods, connecting parks, and accessing Red Rock Canyon. Residents use these trails for walking, jogging, cycling, and dog-walking year-round. The trails are paved, well-maintained, and safe.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Parks are equally impressive. Each neighborhood cluster has its own park, and larger regional parks offer tennis courts, basketball courts, play structures, and picnic areas. The new Summerlin Sports Park adds additional recreational facilities for organized sports.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Summerlin has developed extensive shopping and dining options within the community itself. Downtown Summerlin, a 106-acre mixed-use development, features major retail, restaurants, entertainment, and offices all within walking distance of many homes.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                The Shops at Summerlin offer upscale retail including Apple, Nordstrom, and luxury boutiques. Dining options range from casual chains to upscale restaurants. This convenience means many Summerlin residents rarely need to leave the community for shopping or dining.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Additionally, Summerlin Parkway provides easy access to the Las Vegas Strip, McCarran International Airport, and downtown Las Vegas. The central location means the entire valley is accessible, while the community itself provides everything needed for daily life.

            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900">Schools and Education</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
              Summerlin is home to many of Clark County's top-rated schools. Elementary schools like Givens and Garehime consistently receive A ratings, while Palo Verde High School is one of Nevada's highest-ranked high schools. Many families specifically choose Summerlin for the schools.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
              The community also hosts several charter schools and private schools, providing educational options. Schools are integrated into neighborhood planning, meaning most Summerlin children can walk to elementary school. This convenience and safety add significant value for families.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Beyond K-12, Summerlin is close to multiple higher education institutions. University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV) is just 15 minutes away, and Nevada State College is also accessible. Summerlin's educated population and proximity to universities create a knowledge-based community culture.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Summerlin consistently reports lower crime rates than other Las Vegas neighborhoods. The master-planned nature, active HOAs, well-lit streets, and neighborhood watch programs all contribute to safety. Metropolitan Police Department presence is strong throughout the community.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Many Summerlin gated communities add an additional security layer. Security personnel monitor access, which not only prevents crime but also reduces solicitation and unwanted visitors. Gated communities typically see even better property values and appreciation.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                The overall sense of safety makes Summerlin attractive to families, retirees, and professionals. Parents feel comfortable letting children play outside, walk to friends' houses, and use parks independently. This peace of mind is invaluable and contributes significantly to quality of life.

                Summerlin residents often describe a strong sense of community. HOAs organize events like neighborhood parties, holiday celebrations, and social clubs. The trail system and parks naturally bring neighbors together for casual interactions and friendships.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Summerlin hosts community events throughout the year including farmers markets, concerts, festivals, and seasonal celebrations. These events at Downtown Summerlin and various parks create opportunities for connection and community engagement.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                The community attracts residents who value quality of life, security, and amenities. This shared value system creates a certain culture where neighbors look out for each other, participate in community activities, and take pride in their neighborhoods. This community culture is difficult to quantify but significantly enhances the living experience.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
              When a Summerlin home doesn't sell, it's often due to pricing, presentation, or marketing strategy rather than the property itself. Summerlin's strong market means correctly positioned homes sell quickly and well. Dr. Jan specializes in analyzing why homes expire and creating winning strategies for relisting.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
              Summerlin buyers are often well-informed and have specific expectations. Properties need professional photography showcasing quality, proper staging that highlights features, accurate pricing based on recent comparable sales in the specific sub-community, and strategic marketing that reaches the right buyer pool.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Understanding Summerlin sub-communities matters tremendously for pricing. A home in The Trails commands different pricing than one in Sun City, which differs from The Foothills. Each has distinct buyer profiles, amenities, home styles, and market dynamics. Dr. Jan's expertise in these nuances ensures your property is positioned correctly.

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Beyond just finding properties, Dr. Jan ensures buyers understand what they're getting: HOA benefits and restrictions, school quality, nearby amenities, commute times, and future development that might affect value. This comprehensive approach prevents unpleasant surprises after purchase.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Selling in Summerlin successfully requires proper pricing, professional presentation, and effective marketing. Dr. Jan's experience with expired listings provides unique insight into what works and what doesn't in the Summerlin market.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                She provides detailed pricing analysis comparing your home to recent sales in your specific sub-community. This precision matters because Summerlin has wide price ranges: entry-level condos under $300k to luxury estates over $2 million, with pricing varying significantly even within sub-communities.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Marketing strategy matters too. Summerlin buyers are often specific in their searches - they might want golf course views, pool homes, certain school zones, or specific architectural styles. Dr. Jan ensures your home reaches buyers seeking exactly what you're offering.
