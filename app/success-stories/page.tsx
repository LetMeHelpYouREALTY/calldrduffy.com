              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Every successful relisting starts with honest analysis of what went wrong. Dr. Jan reviews the original listing details: pricing strategy, marketing efforts, showing activity, buyer feedback, and market conditions during listing period.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                She examines comparable sales to understand if pricing was the issue. She reviews photos and staging to assess presentation. She analyzes marketing reach to identify gaps in buyer exposure. This comprehensive analysis reveals specific issues needing attention.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                The analysis isn't about blame but about understanding what prevented success so those issues can be systematically addressed. Most homes have one to two primary issues rather than problems across every area. Identifying these specific issues enables targeted, cost-effective fixes.

            </div>
            
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900">Creating the Action Plan</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Based on analysis, Dr. Jan creates a detailed action plan addressing identified issues. If pricing was the problem, she recommends specific listing price with market justification. If presentation needed work, she outlines staging or photography improvements. If marketing was insufficient, she explains comprehensive promotional strategy.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                The plan includes timeline, costs, expected impact, and expected results. This transparency ensures homeowners understand what will be done, why it matters, and what outcomes to expect. Clear communication builds confidence in the strategy.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Homeowners appreciate knowing upfront what improvements will cost versus expected sale price and time savings. This helps make informed decisions about investing in staging, photography, or marketing to maximize both sale price and speed to closing.

            Your home didn't sell for specific reasons. Those reasons are fixable. Dr. Janet Duffy has made this her specialty, and her success rate proves the approach works.

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900">47 Success Stories in 2024</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                In 2024 alone, Dr. Jan helped 47 homeowners successfully sell properties that had previously expired. These homes averaged 32 days on market with her strategy, compared to their original 180+ day listings that never found buyers.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                The success rate demonstrates that homes that don't sell can absolutely be sold with the right approach. The common denominator in these successes is systematic problem-identification and targeted solutions rather than generic listing approaches.
              </p>

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Her expired listings typically sell in 30-45 days once issues are addressed, compared to their original multi-month listings that never received offers. This speed matters because every month a home sits unsold costs money in mortgage, utilities, insurance, and HOA fees.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Faster sales also mean less stress, ability to move forward with life plans, and reduced risk of price adjustments if market conditions change. The goal isn't just selling but selling quickly at the best price possible.

            <p className="mb-4 text-blue-100">
              The first step is scheduling a free consultation. During this consultation, Dr. Jan reviews your specific situation, analyzes what likely prevented your sale, and outlines a strategic approach customized to your home and goals.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-blue-100">
              There's no obligation, no pressure, just honest professional assessment. She'll tell you if your home is ready to relist immediately or needs improvements first, what those improvements would cost and their expected impact on sale price and time.
            </p>
            <p className="text-blue-100">
              Most homeowners find the consultation provides clarity on why their home didn't sell and confidence in a path forward. From there, it's about executing the strategy and achieving the successful sale you were hoping for initially.
