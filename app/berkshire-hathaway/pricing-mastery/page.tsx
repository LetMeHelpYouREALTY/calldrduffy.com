            The Pricing Problem: 73% Overpriced by 5-15%
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 max-w-3xl">
            Research shows that 73% of expired listings were overpriced by 5-15% - the number one reason homes don't sell. Most agents overprice to win the listing, knowing they'll have to reduce later. This approach wastes your time and money while your home sits on the market.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Dr. Jan has access to proprietary Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices valuation tools that analyze market data, absorption rates, and buyer behavior patterns that generic CMAs miss.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                These tools combine recent comparable sales, current competition, days on market trends, and buyer feedback data to determine optimal pricing strategy.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Result: Pricing based on data, not emotion or what you want to hear.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Dr. Jan survived the 2008 crash and understands how Las Vegas markets cycle. She knows the difference between true market value and emotional pricing that doesn't work.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Her experience includes every market condition: boom markets, crash markets, recovery markets, and balanced markets. This experience prevents pricing mistakes that inexperienced agents make.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                When you price with Dr. Jan, you're pricing with someone who's seen it all and knows what actually sells.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
              Most agents overprice to get your signature, knowing they'll reduce later. Dr. Jan will have the tough conversation upfront: price your home correctly to sell quickly, or price high and watch it sit.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
              She'll show you the data: comparable sales, absorption rates, buyer feedback patterns, and market trends. If the data says your price is too high, she'll tell you directly - because she prices to get your home SOLD, not to win the listing.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              The truth: Most agents overprice to get your signature. Dr. Jan prices to get your home SOLD - even if it means a tough conversation upfront.

            Real-Time Adjustment Strategy

          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 max-w-3xl">
            Even with perfect initial pricing, markets shift. Dr. Jan monitors showing feedback, buyer interest, and competitor activity to adjust strategy in real-time.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                If your initial pricing isn't attracting buyers, Dr. Jan pivots within 14-21 days rather than waiting weeks for the market to catch up. This proactive approach means your home adapts to market conditions immediately.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                She analyzes showing feedback patterns: Are buyers saying price? Are showings happening but no offers? Is competition affecting interest? Based on this data, she adjusts price or marketing strategy quickly.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                The goal: Keep your listing competitive and moving toward sale, not sitting stagnant while hoping something changes.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                You'll receive weekly reports showing buyer feedback themes, showing frequency patterns, and competitor activity. If patterns suggest pricing adjustment needed, it happens immediately.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                This data-driven approach means your pricing strategy evolves based on actual buyer behavior, not guesswork. If buyers consistently say price, adjustment happens. If showings are strong but no offers, different adjustments are made.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Result: Homes priced correctly from start sell faster and for better net proceeds than homes that chase market downward after overpricing initially.
