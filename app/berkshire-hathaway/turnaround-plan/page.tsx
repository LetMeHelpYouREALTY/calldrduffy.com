          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 max-w-3xl">
            The first week with Dr. Jan begins with a complete audit of what went wrong with your previous listing. No sugar-coating, no excuses - just honest assessment of pricing, photos, marketing, and agent effort.

                Dr. Jan will tell you exactly what went wrong: Was pricing too high? Were photos poor quality? Was marketing insufficient? Did agent communication break down? She'll provide the honest assessment you need to fix issues.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                This audit isn't about blaming - it's about identifying specific failures so they can be corrected. Every expired listing has specific problems that can be fixed with the right approach.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Staging isn't about hiding problems - it's about showcasing potential. Buyers need to see how spaces function and how beautiful your home can look when properly presented.

            Week 3 focuses on strategic repricing based on current absorption rates and fresh comparative market analysis. No guessing - pricing based on real market data and current conditions.

                Dr. Jan conducts fresh comparative market analysis using current data: recent comparable sales, active competition, days on market trends, and absorption rates for your specific area.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Markets change constantly. What was appropriate pricing three months ago may not be correct today. Fresh CMAs ensure pricing reflects current market conditions, not outdated data.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                This analysis uses proprietary BHHS valuation tools combined with Dr. Jan's 30 years of Vegas market experience to determine optimal pricing strategy.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Understanding absorption rates tells you how quickly homes are selling in your area at current price points. If absorption is slow, pricing may need adjustment. If absorption is strong, pricing may be on target.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                This data-driven approach means pricing decisions aren't based on hope or emotion - they're based on actual market performance data that shows what prices buyers are accepting.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Result: Strategic repricing that positions your home competitively in current market conditions, not based on what worked months ago when your first listing failed.

              When your previous listing failed, it likely wasn't promoted to agent networks, luxury buyer databases, or international referral partners. Dr. Jan activates all of these channels in Week 4.

            After Week 4, the turnaround plan continues with weekly feedback reports, showing analysis, and strategic adjustments until your home is sold. This ongoing management is what keeps expired listings moving toward sale.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Every week you'll receive detailed reports showing: showing frequency, buyer feedback themes, competitor activity, and strategic recommendations. No more radio silence - you know exactly what's happening with your listing.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              These reports identify patterns: Are buyers consistently saying price? Are showings happening but no offers? Is competition affecting interest? Based on this data, Dr. Jan makes strategic adjustments.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              If price needs adjustment, it happens. If marketing needs enhancement, it happens. If strategy needs pivot, it happens - immediately, not after weeks of stagnation. This proactive management is what turns expired listings into sold properties.
