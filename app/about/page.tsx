                Dr. Janet Duffy is a Las Vegas real estate agent who specializes in helping homeowners whose properties didn't sell the first time around. With over a decade of experience in the Las Vegas real estate market, she has built a reputation for turning challenging situations into successful home sales.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
                What makes Dr. Jan unique is her focus on expired listings - properties that came off the market because they didn't sell. While many agents pursue new listings, fewer actively work with homeowners who had unsuccessful first attempts. This specialization makes her exceptionally effective at diagnosing problems and creating winning strategies.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
                Her track record speaks for itself: in 2024 alone, she helped 47 homeowners successfully sell properties that had previously expired. These homes averaged just 32 days on market with her strategy, compared to their original 180+ day listings that never found buyers. Her 96% client satisfaction rate reflects her commitment to results and communication.

            Why Specialize in Homes That Didn't Sell?
          </h2>
          
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 max-w-3xl">
            Many agents avoid working with expired listings because they seem difficult. Dr. Jan has built her entire practice around these challenges, developing proven strategies that consistently work.
          </p>

          <div className="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-8 mb-12">
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900">The Real Problem with Homes That Don't Sell</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                In her experience working with over 100 expired listings, Dr. Jan has identified that homes don't sell for three main reasons: pricing, presentation, or promotion. The good news? All three are fixable with the right strategy.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Pricing issues are most common. Homes priced above market value sit indefinitely while properly priced homes in the same neighborhood sell quickly. Dr. Jan provides detailed market analyses showing exactly where the market is and how to position properties competitively.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Presentation problems include poor staging, lackluster photography, outdated décor, or maintenance issues that turn off buyers. Presentation matters tremendously - professional staging and photography alone can make the difference between selling and sitting.
              </p>
            </div>
            
            <div>
              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-gray-900">Promotion and Marketing Gaps</h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Marketing reach is often the third issue. Many expired listings had minimal marketing beyond the MLS - maybe an open house or two but not the comprehensive digital marketing strategy needed in today's market.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Dr. Jan's marketing approach is aggressive and multi-channel: professional photography and videography, social media promotion, targeted digital advertising, neighborhood marketing, agent network outreach, and strategic showing schedules. The goal is maximum exposure to serious buyers.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                What sets her apart is understanding that these three issues often overlap. A home might have two of the three problems, or all three. Her initial analysis identifies every issue, then creates a comprehensive action plan addressing each aspect systematically.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div className="bg-blue-600 text-white p-8 rounded-lg mb-8">
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Success Through Systematic Problem-Solving</h3>
            <p className="mb-4 text-blue-100">
              Dr. Jan's process starts with honest assessment: why didn't it sell? She analyzes the original listing price versus actual market value. She reviews the photos and staging. She examines the marketing efforts and showing feedback. She speaks with the previous agent when possible to understand what feedback came in.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-blue-100">
              This detective work reveals the specific issues. From there, she creates a personalized strategy. For a pricing issue, she provides detailed comparables showing exactly where to price. For presentation, she either works with the seller on improvements or invests in professional staging and photography. For marketing gaps, she implements her aggressive multi-channel approach.
            </p>
            <p className="text-blue-100">
              The result? Homes that sit unsold for 6 months sell in 3-4 weeks. Properties with no offers suddenly attract multiple offers. Frustrated homeowners become successful sellers. This systematic approach is why she maintains such strong results despite working with what many consider "difficult" listings.

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                She understands how each area's market differs - what works in Summerlin doesn't necessarily work in Henderson. Her hyperlocal knowledge means she knows the schools, HOA cultures, market trends, and buyer profiles for each neighborhood.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Working with Dr. Jan starts with a comprehensive consultation where she learns about your situation. She wants to understand what happened with the original listing: why did you choose that agent, how was the home priced, what marketing was done, what feedback came from showings?
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Then she conducts her own analysis. She examines your home in person, reviews comparable sales, studies the competition, analyzes market conditions, and identifies the specific issues that likely prevented sale. This assessment is thorough and honest - she'll tell you exactly what needs addressing.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                The goal isn't to criticize previous efforts but to understand what didn't work so those same mistakes aren't repeated. Her assessment provides clarity on what needs fixing and why, giving homeowners confidence in the strategy moving forward.

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Once the issues are identified, Dr. Jan creates a detailed action plan customized to your specific situation. This plan addresses pricing, presentation, and marketing systematically. It's not generic advice - it's a tailored strategy for your home, your neighborhood, and your goals.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                The plan includes specific recommendations: pricing adjustments with market justification, staging suggestions or professional staging investment, photography and videography, marketing channels and timeline, and showing strategy. Everything is explained in terms of impact on time to sale and sale price.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Homeowners appreciate this transparency and detail. You'll know exactly what will be done, why each step matters, and what results to expect. This clear communication and upfront planning builds confidence and trust throughout the selling process.

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
              Dr. Jan maintains consistent communication throughout the selling process. Homeowners receive regular updates on showing activity, buyer feedback, market changes, and strategic adjustments. She's responsive to questions and proactive in managing issues as they arise.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
              Her approach combines proven systematic strategies with flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions and buyer feedback. If something isn't working, she adjusts quickly rather than continuing ineffective approaches. This agility comes from experience working with challenging situations.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              The result is usually success where there was previous failure. Most of her clients see their homes sell within 30-45 days, often with multiple offers. The combination of proper pricing, strong presentation, aggressive marketing, and experienced negotiation delivers results that turn frustrated homeowners into happy sellers.
